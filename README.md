# Event Log Analyzer

Personal Python project for practicing file handling, data normalization and rule-based analysis.

This project was developed as a learning exercise, using AI-assisted guidance for reasoning and code review. All logic, implementation decisions and refinements were written, tested and adjusted manually.

## Features
- Reads events from a text file
- Normalizes entries (lowercase, underscores)
- Aggregates event frequency
- Assigns severity levels based on event type and occurrence count
- Handles missing or empty files

## Usage
```bash
python analyzer.py
